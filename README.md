# Data Exploration with Python - Jupyter Notebook
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating various combinations of data analysis techniques in Python using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks exploring different combinations of datasets and analysis techniques.
- `data/`: Includes sample datasets used in the notebooks.

## Notebook Overview
1. **Exploring Numerical Data**: This notebook demonstrates techniques for exploring numerical data, including summary statistics, histograms, and scatter plots.
2. **Exploring Categorical Data**: Here, we delve into analyzing categorical data, showing frequency counts, bar plots.
3. **Combining Numerical and Categorical Data**: This notebook illustrates methods for analyzing datasets containing both numerical and categorical variables, such as grouped bar plots and box plots.

## Requirements
The project requires Python 3 and the following libraries:
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

Models required:
- **LogisticsRegression from sklearn.linear_model**
- **RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.ensemble**
- **KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors**

You can install these libraries using `pip`: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter.
